1)You are given an integer array 'A' of size 'N', sorted in non-decreasing order. You are also given an integer 'target'. Your task is to write a function to search for 
'target' in the array 'A'. If it exists, return its index in 0-based indexing using Linear Search.


2)College library has N books. Write a C++ program to store the cost of books in an array in ascending order. Books are to be arranged in descending order of their cost. 
Write functions for:
    A) Copy costs of books those with cost less than 500 in a new array.
    a) Delete the duplicate entries using a temporary array.
    b) Delete duplicate entries without using a temporary array.
    c) Count the number of books with cost more than 500.

3)Write a C++ program to store roll numbers of students in an array who attended a training program in random order. Write functions for:
    a) Searching whether a particular student attended the training program or not using Linear Search.
    OR
    b) Searching whether a particular student attended the training program or not using Binary Search.

4)Implement a C++ program for expression conversion from infix to postfix using a stack.

5)A palindrome is a string of characters that is the same forward and backward. Typically, punctuation, capitalization, and spaces are ignored. For example, 
"Poor Dan is in a droop" is a palindrome, as can be seen by examining the characters "poordanisinadroop" and observing that they are the same forward and backward. 
One way to check for a palindrome is to reverse the characters in the string and then compare with the originalâ€”in a palindrome, the sequence will be identical. 
Write a C++ program with functions to check whether a given string is a palindrome or not that uses a stack to determine whether a string is a palindrome.

6)A double-ended queue (deque) is a linear list in which additions and deletions may be made at either end. Obtain a data representation mapping a deque into a 
one-dimensional array. Write a C++ program to simulate a deque with functions to add and delete elements from either end of the deque.

7)A pizza parlor accepts a maximum of M orders. Orders are served on a first-come, first-served basis. Order once placed cannot be canceled. Write a C++ program to 
simulate the system using a queue with an array.

8)A library needs to manage a collection of books (data fields such as book title, author, ISBN, availability status, and other relevant information), maintain 
information about each book, support operations like adding, removing, and searching for books, and provide efficient access to library resources. Use the concept of 
Linked List for implementation of the Library Management system.

9)A Charity Management system needs to manage the information about donors, donations, and other relevant data. The system needs to maintain information about each donor. 
The system should be able to add a new donor, remove the donor, update the information of the donor, search for a specific donor, and display the information of all the 
donors which are present in the database. Use the concept of the Linked List to implement the above system.

10)A Music Library System is a software application used to manage the storage and retrieval of music tracks and albums. The system needs to maintain information such as
track title, artist, album, genre, duration, release year, and any other relevant attributes. The system should be able to add a new music track, remove the track, 
update the information of the track, search for a specific track, and display the information of all the tracks which are present in the database. Use the concept of 
Circular Linked List to implement the above system.
